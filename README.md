# imgur uploader
An update to an imgur uploader from http://imguruploader.codeplex.com/  
It was my favourite uploader but has been broken for a bit because of deprecated api.  
Mostly updated the API, removed features I never use, made the copy link a bit better, etc.  
This was mostly a learning opportunity for C#.  This is not suppose to be good.

Install instructions:  
Install the original, build the source or grab whatever is already built, and copy all of it to wherever you installed the original.
